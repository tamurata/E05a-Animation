From this Assighnment, I learned more how to add the images(sprites) on the background.
also, the codes which moves the character correctly
How to make the mouse pointer invisible as well.
It was quite fun again!  I am pretty much looking forward and scared to work on Space shooter.
It is going to be so much work...
